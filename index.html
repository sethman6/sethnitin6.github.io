        <hr> This is my sincere and serious first attempt to create a blog page and complete some Html and CSS coding.
      I have been trying to learn to do this for a long time however kept pushing it back due to one reason or the another.
      I would find excuse evertime and blame it on lack of not having enough time in my life or maybe it was somethign else (I would
      never know).
      <br> One day I woke up and decided enough is enough and to practice what I try and preach my kids hence this decision to
        enrol in Dev Academy. It has been a satisying journey so far and I am enjoying being pushed and challenged.
      
      <br> Next on the agenda is Learning Python and Java scripts.
      <p class="h2"> About me </p>
      
      <p> <hr>
      I am a 40 year old father of two kids, a teenage daughter and a school aged son. Life is busy and full of challenges
      especially with my dear teenager...haha.
      
      <br>My whole family has been very supportive of my efforts to try and learn something new and embark on this new nd exciting chapter
      in my life.
        <br> I fully embrace the concept of life begining at 40 and am looking forward to what life brings next.
